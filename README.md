Introduction
In data analysis, SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool for querying and manipulating databases. This repository provides a summary of key SQL concepts and showcases SQL techniques frequently used in data analysis projects to ensure comprehensive and accurate analysis, perform advanced calculations, and derive actionable insights.

Key SQL Concepts
Joins: Combining data from multiple tables.
Window Functions: Performing advanced calculations over a set of table rows.
Shared Procedures: Reusing SQL code through stored procedures.
Subqueries: Embedding queries within other queries.
Frequently Used SQL Functions
Aggregate Functions
SUM(): Calculates the sum of a set of values.
AVG(): Calculates the average of a set of values.
COUNT(): Counts the number of rows.
MAX(): Finds the maximum value.
MIN(): Finds the minimum value.
Window Functions
ROW_NUMBER(): Assigns a unique sequential integer to rows within a partition.
RANK(): Assigns a rank to rows within a partition of a result set.
DENSE_RANK(): Similar to RANK() but without gaps in ranking values.
NTILE(): Divides rows into a specified number of approximately equal groups.
LEAD() and LAG(): Accesses data from subsequent and preceding rows, respectively.
